  description: >
    The personal identification number of the person. Although the PIN is optional for some documents 
    it is strongly advised to add information in this section, not only for the receiving 
    institution but also for the sending institution. This will make the process significantly 
    easier to complete successfully. Exceptions should be made only for the rare cases where the 
    PIN in the sending country is not known or doesn't exist.
